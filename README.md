Depending on the library and the target OS, the most reasonable approach is to have it listed as a dependency in the README, along with good documentation on how to install it on all target operating systems, or links to resources that describe how to install it. Maybe, if possible, provide an automated script, but it's not really necessary and not really helpful since building from source should be reserved to developers and power users.

For "normal" users, you should provide binaries that integrate with the operating system's dependency manager (preferably) or just contain a copy of the library.
